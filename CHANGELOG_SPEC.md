
# CHANGELOG for HED specification

The initial version of the HED specification was created and unofficially released in conjunction
with the first release of the HED schema vocabulary version 8.0.0 on Aug 8, 2021. 
However, the versioning of the specification was informal, and minor changes were 
made in the specification document as tool implementation proceeded.

Starting on October 27, 2022, the HED Working Group decided to separate the versioning 
of the HED specification document and the HED schema vocabulary.
The HED Working Group recognized that new features would be incorporated into the
HED infrastructure without the need to change the HED vocabulary.

The first separated version of the HED specification document is HEDSpec 3.0.0
recognizing correspondence between this version of the specification and the initial
release of the HED-3G infrastructure.

## Initial release 3.0.0 Oct. 27, 2022.
