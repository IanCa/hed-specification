# hedxml-test directory

This directory is meant to hold preliminary versions of the HED schema for testing purposes. Once a
HEDxxx.xml file is moved to the [hedxml directory](https://github.com/hed-standard/hed-specification/tree/master/hedxml)
directory, it is available for use in annotation by tools and has a permanent archival footprint. HED schema
in this directory are not expected to be used for purposes other than testing and may change at any time.
