# 3. The HED schema

A HED schema is the formal specification of the HED vocabulary and rules for annotating events.
The HED schema vocabulary is organized hierarchically so that similar concepts and terms appear
close to one another in the organizational hierarchy. (See the 
[expandable schema viewer](https://www.hedtags.org/display_hed.html).)
Valid HED annotations must be drawn from a HED schema vocabulary and HED validators 
and other tools use the information encoded in the relevant schema when 
performing validation and other processing of HED annotations.

Users must provide the version of the HED schema they are using when creating an annotation.
Past, present, and future versions of the HED schema adhere to 
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) with version numbers of the form 
*x.y.z* representing *major.minor.patch* versions. Although schema developers work with HED
schema in `.mediawiki` format for ease in editing,  HED tools generally use XML versions
of the HED schema. 

````{admonition} **Standard development process for XML schema.**
:class: tip

1. Create or modify a `.mediawiki` file containing the schema.
2. Convert to `.xml` using the [HED tools](https://hedtools.ucsd.edu/hed/schema).
3. View in the [expandable schema viewer](https://www.hedtags.org/display_hed.html) to verify.
````

HED schema XML filenames use the standardized format `HEDx.y.z.xml`. These standardized names
make it easier for tools to locate the appropriate HED schema version in the HED working group
[GitHub website](https://github.com/hed-standard). The XML schema versions are stored in the
[`hedxml`](https://github.com/hed-standard/hed-specification/tree/master/hedxml) directory of the
[HED specification repository](https://github.com/hed-standard/hed-specification). 

Third generation HED begins with schema version 8.0.0. Thus, the file containing the first 
official release of the third generation HED schema is `HED8.0.0.xml`. Note: HED versions
*8.0.0-alpha.1* through *8.0.0-beta.5* are prerelease versions of HED-3G and should not be 
used as they will eventually be deprecated.

Releases are stored in [`hedxml`](https://github.com/hed-standard/hed-specification/tree/master/hedxml) 
directory of the [`hed-specification`](https://github.com/hed-standard/hed-specification) repository. 
Deprecated versions of the HED schema are stored in the 
[`hedxml/deprecated`](https://github.com/hed-standard/hed-specification/tree/master/hedxml/deprecated) 
directory of the [`hed-specification`](https://github.com/hed-standard/hed-specification) repository.

All data recordings in a dataset should be annotated using a single version of the standard 
HED schema. Validation and analysis tools are not expected to handle multiple versions of 
the standard HED schema when processing a dataset. Datasets may also include annotations 
from multiple HED library schema extensions in addition to those from the standard schema, 
as described in [Chapter 7: Library schema](07_Library_schema.md#7-library-schema) of this document. 
A more detailed discussion of the HED schema format appears in 
[Appendix A](Appendix_A.md#a-schema-format).


## 3.1. Mediawiki schema format

HED schema developers usually specify schema in `.mediawiki` format for more convenient editing,
display, and reference on GitHub. However, tools assume that the schema is in .mediawiki format. 
Conversion tools allow The following brief example illustrates the format. A full description 
of the format is given in [Appendix A](Appendix_A.md#a-schema-format).

```

````

Beginning with third generation HED (HED schema versions 8.0.0 and later), **terms in a given schema must be unique within that schema.** This uniqueness rule allows automated expansion of short form HED strings into their full long forms. 

Top level tree root elements are enclosed by triple single quotes. Each child term within the
schema must be on a single line that begins with a certain number of consecutive asterisks (`*`)
corresponding to the termâ€™s level within the hierarchy. The term or node name is separate from
its level-indicating asterisks by a space.

Everything after each HED term must be enclosed by `<nowiki></nowiki>` markup elements. Items within these markup elements include a term description and term attributes. 

Term (node element) descriptions are enclosed in square brackets (`[ ]`) in the `.mediawiki`
specification and indicate the meaning of the term or tag they modify. 

HED term attributes are enclosed with curly braces (`{ }`). These term attribute provide
additional rules about how the tag and modifying values should be used and handled by tools.
Allowed HED term attributes include unit class and value class values as well as
HED schema attributes that do not have the `unitClassProperty`, `unitModifierProperty`,
`unitProperty`, or `valueClassProperty`. 

HED term attributes appear in the schema specification either as `name` attributes or as 
`name=value` pairs. The presence of a `name` attribute for a schema node element indicates 
that the attribute is true for that term, while the presence of a `name=value` attribute 
indicates that the attribute has the specified value for that term. If multiple values 
of a particular attribute are applicable, they should be specified as separate name-value pairs.

The hashtag character (`#`) is a placeholder for a user-supplied value. Within the HED schema a
`#` node indicates that the user must supply a value consistent with the unit classes and value
classes of the `#` node if it has any.  Lines with hashtag (`#`) placeholders should have
everything after the asterisks enclosed by `<nowiki></nowiki>` markup elements. The values of HED
tag placeholders cannot stand alone, but must include the parent when used in a HED string.  
In the above example, the `#` that is a child of the *Label* node must include *Label* when 
used (e.g., *Label/myLabel*). 


## 3.2. XML schema format

The HED XML version of the schema is used during validation and analysis. 
The `.xml` format has changed with the release of HED-3G. This modification of the 
XML format was done for the following reasons.

````{admonition} **Reasons for XML file format change for HED.**
:class: tip

1. To correctly handle multiple values of schema attributes.
2. To preserve the prologue and epilogue information present in `.mediawiki` files.
3. To allow schema attributes to be formally specified and validated.
4. To allow an XSD specification of the HED schema for validation of the schema.
````

The following is a translation of the `.mediawiki` example from the previous section in 
the new XML format. A complete specification of the format is given in 
[Appendix A: Schema format](Appendix_A.md#a-schema-format).

### 3.2.1  The `<node>` element

Each `<node>` element must have a `<name>` child element corresponding to the HED tag term 
that it specifies. A `<node>` element may also have a `<description>` child element containing
the text that appears in square brackets (`[ ]`) in the `.mediawiki` version. 
The schema attributes (which appear as `name` values or `name-value` pairs enclosed in 
curly braces {} in the `.mediawiki` file) are translated into `<attribute>` child elements
of `<node>` in the `.xml`. 

### 3.2.2 Unit classes and modifiers

The HED schema also includes a `<unitClassDefinitions>` section that specifies the allowed 
unit classes and the corresponding allowed unit names. Only the singular version of each unit name is explicitly specified, but the corresponding plurals of the explicitly mentioned 
singular versions are also allowed (e.g., `feet` is allowed in addition to `foot`). 
HED uses a `pluralize` function available in both Python and Javascript to check validity.  

The `<unitModifierDefinitions>` section lists the SI unit multiples and submultiples 
that are allowed to be prepended to units that have the `SIUnit` schema attribute. 

### 3.2.3 Value classes

The `<valueClassDefinitions> `section specifies rules for the values that are substituted 
for placeholders (`#`). Examples are special characters that are allowed for numeric values 
or dates. Placeholders that have no `valueClass` attributes, are assumed to follow the 
rules for HED tag naming described in the next section.

### 3.2.4 Schema attributes

The `<schemaAttributeDefinitions>` section lists the schema attributes that apply to some 
nodes and definitions in other sections of the schema. The specification of which type of
elements an attribute may apply to is specified by the property attributes of these schema
attributes. 

### 3.2.5 Schema properties

The `<schemaPropertyDefinitions>` section lists properties of the schema attributes, themselves.
This specification allows general validation to handle a lot of the processing directly based
on the HED schema contents rather than on hard-coded implementation. 

## 3.3. Allowed characters

The different parts of the HED schema and associated HED tags have different rules 
for the characters that are allowed. UTF-8 characters are not supported. Schema designers
and users that extend HED schema must use node or term names that conform to the rules 
for `valueClass=nameClass`. Placeholder values that donâ€™t have 
an associated `valueClass` attribute are also assumed to have `valueClass=nameClass`.


`````{list-table}  Rules for valid HED characters.
:header-rows: 1
:widths: 20 50

* - Element
  - Allowed characters
* - Node (`nameClass`)
  - Alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underbars with no white space.
* - Description (`textClass`)
  - Alphanumeric characters, blanks, commas, periods, semicolons,<br/> 
  colons, hyphens, underbars, forward slashes, carets (^), and parentheses.  
* - Placeholder (`#`)
  - A special node value which indicates a later substitution.
* - Placeholder children
  - Depends on `valueClass` as well as allowed `unitClass` and unit modifiers.
* - Library names
  - A single word containing only alphabetic characters.
* - Namespaces
  - A single alphabetic word followed by a single colon. 
`````

````{admonition} Notes on rules for allowed characters in the HED schema. 
:class: tip
1. The first letter of a term should be capitalized with the remainder lower case. 
2. Terms containing multiple words cannot contain blanks and should be hyphenated.
3. Blanks around comma and parentheses delimiters are not part of a tag.
4. Descriptions should be concise sentences, possibly with clarifying examples.
5. Descriptions cannot contain square brackets, curly braces, quotes, or punctuation 
not specifically allowed by `textClass`.
6. Values substituted for `#` may have special characters determined by the value class.
For example, the colon (:) is specifically allowed for the `dateTimeClass` value class.
7. Units are separated from their value by at least one blank whether prefix or suffix.
8. Library namespace names are local and consist of a short alphabetic word followed by a single colon.
````

### 3.3.2 Placeholder values

Blanks are allowed as are periods, dollar (`$`), percent (`%`), caret (`^`), plus (`+`), 
minus(`-`), under bar(`_`), and semicolon (`;`). Values must conform to the underlying 
unit classes of the placeholder specification.

Certain unit classes allow other special characters in their value specification. 
These special characters are specified in the schema with the `allowedCharacter` attribute. 
An example of this is the colon in the `dateTimeClass` unit class.

## 3.4. Vocabulary organization

The HED-3G schema (version 8.0.0 and above) contains six root trees of HED terms: *Event*,
*Agent*, *Action*, *Item*, *Property*, and *Relation*. 

The *Event* root tree terms indicate the general category of the event, such as whether it 
is a sensory event, an agent action, a data feature, or an event indicating experiment 
control or structure. The HED annotations describing each event may be assembled from a 
number of sources during processing. 

The assembled HED string annotating an event should have at least one tag from the 
*Event* tree, as many analysis tools use the *Event* tags as a primary means of 
segregating, epoching, and processing the data. Ideally, tags from the *Event* 
subtree should appear at the top level of the HED annotation describing an 
event to facilitate analysis.

The *Agent* root tree terms indicate types of agents (e.g., persons, animals, avatars)
that take an active role or produce a specified effect. An *Agent* tag should be 
grouped with property tags that provide information about the agent, such as 
whether the agent is an experiment participant.

The *Action* root tree terms describe actions performed by agents. Generally these are
grouped in a triple *(A, (Action, B))* which is interpreted as *A* does *Action* on *B*. 
If the action does not have a target, it should be annotated *(A, (Action))*, meaning
*A* does *Action*.

The *Item* root tree terms describe things with (actual or virtual) physical existence
such as objects, sounds, or language. 

Descriptive elements are organized in the *Property* rooted tree. These descriptive
elements should always be grouped with the elements they describe using parentheses. 

Binary relations are in the *Relation* rooted tree. Like items from the *Action*
sub-tree, these should be annotated using *(A, (Relation, B))*.


## 3.5. Tag syntax

A **HED tag** is a term in the HED vocabulary identified by a path consisting of the 
individual node names from some branch of the HED schema hierarchy separated by forward 
slashes (/). 
An important requirement of third generation HED is that the node names in 
the HED schema **must be unique**. As a consequence, the user can specify as much of the path to the 
root as desired. The full path version is referred to as **long form** and truncated versions as 
**short form**. HED tools are available to map between shortened tags and long form as needed. 
Any intermediate form of the tag path is also allowed as illustrated by this example:

````{admonition} **Example:** Equivalent forms for HED tag representing a triangle.

1. *Item/Object/Geometric-object/2D-shape/Triangle*  
2. *Object/Geometric-object/2D-shape/Triangle*  
3. *Geometric-object/2D-shape/Triangle*  
4. *2D-shape/Triangle*  
5. *Triangle* 
````

For values that are substituted for a placeholder (`#`) child, the tag must include the parent
as illustrated in this example for the  *Label* tag. The values that replace these `#`
placeholders cannot be node names.

````{admonition} **Example:** Equivalent forms for HED tag representing the label Image1.

1. *Property/Informational-property/Label/Image1*  
2. *Informational-property/Label/Image1*  
3. *Label/Image1* 
````
 
A **HED string** is a comma-separated list of HED tags and/or HED tag groups. 
A **HED tag group** is a comma-separated list of HED tags and/or tag groups enclosed in
parentheses. Tag groups may include other tag groups. Parentheses convey association, 
since HED strings are unordered lists. The terms in a HED string must be unique, 
thus, a HED string forms a set.

````{admonition} **Example:** Nested HED tag group indicated press.

**Short form:**  
> *((Human-agent, Experiment-participant), (Press, Mouse-button))*

**Long form:**
> *((Agent/<strong>Human-agent</strong>,*  
>    *Property/Agent-property/Agent-task-role/<strong>Experiment-participant</strong>),*  
> *(Action/Move/Move-body-part/Move-upper-extremity/<strong>Press</strong>,*  
> *Item/Object/Man-made-object/Device/IO-device/Input-device/Computer-mouse/<strong>Mouse-button</strong>))*  

````

The validation errors for HED tags and HED strings are summarized in
[Appendix B: HED errors](Appendix_B.md#b-hed-errors).

**HED `#` placeholders** cannot have siblings. Thus, tags that have placeholder 
children cannot be extended even if they inherit an `extensionAllowed` attribute 
from an ancestor. The parsers treat any child of these tags as a value rather than a tag.  

**HED values** can be strings or numeric values followed by a unit specification. 
If a `unitClass` is specified as an attribute of the `#` node, then the units specified 
must be valid units for that `unitClass`. **HED parsers assume that units are separated from 
values by at least one blank.**
